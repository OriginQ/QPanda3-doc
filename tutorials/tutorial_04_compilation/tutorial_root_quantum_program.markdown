The Quantum Intermediate Compiler chapter focuses on two quantum hardware description languages, OriginIR and OpenQASM, where OriginIR is an intermediate representation of quantum programs based on %QPanda3, and plays a very important role in supporting various features of %QPanda3. And QpenQASM is a command programming language introduced by IBM, which can be compatible with a variety of quantum hardware platforms.

In addition to describing the quantum gates and command operations supported by OriginIR and OpenQASM, respectively, the translation interfaces and example usage of the interfaces for translating quantum programs described by these two assembly languages into QProg supported by QPanda3 are also presented.

The Quantum Intermediate Compiler chapter is divided as follows:

- @subpage tutorial_quantum_program_of_content_OriginIR - %QPanda3 Quantum Program Intermediate Representation
- @subpage tutorial_quantum_program_of_content_QASM - IBM Open Quantum Assembly Language
