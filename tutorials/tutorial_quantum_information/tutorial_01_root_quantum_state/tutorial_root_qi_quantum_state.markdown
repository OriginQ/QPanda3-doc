# Quantum State

In quantum mechanics, the quantum state is a fundamental concept that describes the state of a quantum system. The state of a quantum system can be represented in two primary ways: state vectors and density matrices.


## Density Matrix

The density matrix is a crucial concept in quantum mechanics, which is used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when there is interaction between the system and the environment.
QPanda3 uses the DensityMatrix class to simulate density matrix in this section

## State Vector
A state vector is a mathematical object used to abstractly represent a quantum state. In quantum mechanics, the state of a system is often described in a Hilbert space, a complex vector space that allows for the representation of quantum states. The state vector is a vector in this Hilbert space, and it contains all the information needed to describe the quantum state. QPanda3 uses the StateVector class to simulate state vectors in this section
