# Analysis Tools

In the current version, QPanda3 provides tools for calculating the Hellinger distance, Hellinger divergence, and KL divergence.

## Hellinger Distance

In the quantum field, Hellinger Distance is mainly used to measure the similarity between two probability distributions. This concept originated from probability statistics and information theory and is widely used in machine learning. 

## Hellinger Fidelity

Hellinger fidelity, also known as Hellinger distance-based fidelity, is a measure of the similarity between two probability distributions. 

## KL Divergence

The KL divergence in the quantum domain is an important concept used to measure the difference or information loss between two quantum probability distributions.
